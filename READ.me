⚙️ 2D Physics Engine (Simplified)

This project implements a modular 2D rigid body physics engine built from scratch in Python.
Unlike standalone simulation scripts, this project focuses on engine architecture, physics infrastructure, and clean separation between computation and rendering.

The engine simulates circular rigid bodies under gravity, resolves collisions using impulse-based methods, and supports basic positional constraints.
